People News
========================

Today's communications play a fundamental role, but at least in Chile there is a digital media and serious information that allows the active participation of the people, as most have rigid structures and just allow the participation.

Our scope is that of the digital media, our goal is to reach the so-called "game news", those who do not have a formal, centralized means with the scheme of a daily, enabling them to share information of everyday events and digital reporting.

Our platform is oriented to any person who likes to find out or that you would like to publish daily news of local interest, from the own point of view and not a mega corporation of news-oriented. Which publishes both which reads are users and are our main focus.
 Our actors are also reporters who want to be known massively and that have not found a traditional medium where inserted, giving them the opportunity to become known, so are given a high priority because they will be the main creators of content.
 Key stakeholders are us, and potential advertisers on the site, which only them will be interested in the number of visits that have and that this report them benefits.
 
 # The solution
 
 We created a web portal that will allow the relationship between a user and the generation of custom content knowing their data, for this relationship will use a database.
 
 To identify the user, think to take advantage of connecting with external interfaces such as Facebook to acquire more data that the user shares, and thus to be able to add to our databases, and applications to deliver better service and finally allow the user to a recognition of their tastes and interests based on this relationship with the platform of this social network or others.
 
 This solution allows you to read news of interest to the reader, with an added value which is freedom of the press which will open to the world, the news will no longer be something exclusively of professionals, but Los and people interested in writing and with a certain level, you can also provide information, so it is somehow democratizing.

1) Download the Standard Edition
--------------------------------

### Clone the git Repository

We highly recommend that you download the packaged version of this distribution.
But if you still want to use Git, you are on your own.

Run the following commands:

    git clone http://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard.git
    cd symfony-standard
    rm -rf .git

2) Installation
---------------

Once you've downloaded the standard edition, installation is easy, and basically
involves making sure your system is ready for Symfony.

### a) Check your System Configuration

Before you begin, make sure that your local system is properly configured
for Symfony. To do this, execute the following:

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix these now before moving on.

### b) Install the Vendor Libraries

If you downloaded the archive "without vendors" or installed via git, then
you need to download all of the necessary vendor libraries. If you're not
sure if you need to do this, check to see if you have a ``vendor/`` directory.
If you don't, or if that directory is empty, run the following:

    php bin/vendors install

Note that you **must** have git installed and be able to execute the `git`
command to execute this script. If you don't have git available, either install
it or download Symfony with the vendor libraries already included.

### c) Access the Application via the Browser

Congratulations! You're now ready to use Symfony. If you've unzipped Symfony
in the web root of your computer, then you should be able to access the
web version of the Symfony requirements check via:

    http://localhost/Symfony/web/config.php

If everything looks good, click the "Bypass configuration and go to the Welcome page"
link to load up your first Symfony page.

You can also use a web-based configurator by clicking on the "Configure your
Symfony Application online" link of the ``config.php`` page.

To see a real-live Symfony page in action, access the following page:

    web/app_dev.php/demo/hello/Fabien

3) Learn about Symfony!
-----------------------

This distribution is meant to be the starting point for your application,
but it also contains some sample code that you can learn from and play with.

A great way to start learning Symfony is via the [Quick Tour](http://symfony.com/doc/current/quick_tour/the_big_picture.html),
which will take you through all the basic features of Symfony2 and the test
pages that are available in the standard edition.

Once you're feeling good, you can move onto reading the official
[Symfony2 book](http://symfony.com/doc/current/).

Enjoy!
